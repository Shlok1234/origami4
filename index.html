    <h4>Here you can learn some basic origami designs.</h4>

    <div class="center">
    <div class="origami">
    <a href="http://origami.me/camel/"><h1>Camel</h1><img src= images/camel-19-min.jpg width = 300 height = 300></a>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Camels are mammals with long legs, a big-lipped snout and a humped back.</li>
        <li>There are two types of camels: dromedary camels, which have one hump, and Bactrian camels, which have two humps.</li>
        <li>Camels' humps consist of stored fat, which they can metabolize when food and water is scarce.</li>
    </ul></div><hr>

    <div class="origami">
    <a href="http://origami.me/chameleon/"><h1>Chameleon</h1><img src= images/chameleon-13-min.jpg width = 300 height = 300></a>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Chameleons are reptiles that are part of the iguana suborder.</li>
        <li>These colorful lizards are known as one of the few animals that can change skin color.</li>
        <li>However, it is a misconception that chameleons change colors to match their surroundings.</li>
    </ol></div><hr>

    <div class="origami">
    <a href="http://origami.me/pigeon/"><h1>Pigeon</h1><img src= images/pigeon-9.jpg width = 300 height = 300></a>
    <ul>
        <li>Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition. They can also recognise each letter of the human alphabet, differentiate between photographs, and even distinguish different humans within a photograph.</li>
        <li>Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills, such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. A study at Oxford University found that they will also use landmarks as signposts and will travel along man-made roads and motorways, even changing direction at junctions.</li>
        <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>
    </ul></div><hr>

    <div class = "origami">
    <a href="http://origami.me/teddy-bear/"><h1>Teddy Bear</h1><img src= images/teddy-16-min.jpg width = 300 height = 300></a>
    <ul>
        <li>The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip.</li>
        <li>Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.</li>
    </ul></div><hr>

    <div class = "origami">
    <a href="http://origami.me/panda/"><h1>Panda</h1><img src= images/panda-9-min.jpg width = 300 height = 300></a>
    <ul>
        <li>Giant panda looks cuddly and cute when you search photos on the internet. But it's much bigger than you think. An adult panda weight more than 45 kilos (100 pounds), and can be about 1.5 meters (5 feet) long!</li>
        <li>Giant pandas are good at climbing trees and can also swim.</li>
